# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Tailwind 
install Tailwind CSS with Create React App
Setting up Tailwind CSS in a Create React App project.

Create React App does not support custom PostCSS configurations and is incompatible with many important tools in the PostCSS ecosystem, like `postcss-import`.

We highly recommend using Vite, Parcel, Next.js, or Remix instead of Create React App. They provide an equivalent or better developer experience but with more flexibility, giving you more control over how Tailwind and PostCSS are configured.

Create your project
Start by creating a new React project with Create React App v5.0+ if you don't have one already set up.

Terminal

npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project
Install Tailwind CSS
Install tailwindcss via npm, and then run the init command to generate your tailwind.config.js file.

Terminal

npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
Configure your template paths
Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.

tailwind.config.js

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your ./src/index.css file.

index.css

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Start your build process
Run your build process with npm run start.

Terminal

npm run start
Start using Tailwind in your project
Start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.

App.js

export default function App() {
  return (
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Hello world!
